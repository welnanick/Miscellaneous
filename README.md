#My Miscellaneous files

I wanted a place to put files I may need anywhere, such as a .vimrc or Jetbrains Code style files 

###File Descriptions:

.vimrc: Self explanitory, this is the .vimrc file I use when I use vim. 

Java Code Style.xml: This is the xml file that contains my prefered Java Coding Style for use in
Jetbrains IDEs.
